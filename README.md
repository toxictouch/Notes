## Brief Description

I created this demo by following the Microsoft tutorial for a MAUI app called notes. The tutorial can be accessed by visting this link: [Create a .NET MAUI App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/).

The application should compile successfully if you choose to clone the project. Some minor changes were implemented; such as sporadic, in-depth comments and re-naming of methods (largely to match C# conventions).
